# Applied-Machine-Learning-Coursera

While the phone will focus mainly on data processing questions, a potential future onsite portion requires the ability to manipulate data structures and implement common algorithms. Here is a resource with common data structures/algorithms (arrays, lists, dictionaries/hashtables, trees, graph search, etc.) that we provide for all data scientists that proceed to the onsite interview stage: http://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/ . We donâ€™t expect coding at the level of a software engineer, but having some general purpose programming background in the methods listed will set you up for success in that portion of our interviews later on.

A few helpful hints:

Think out loud if you are working through a solution you are presented with as the Engineer will want to know how you approach and troubleshoot problems. And also even before you begin coding your solution on the white board, give yourself a minute to think through what you will write. 
If the interviewer gives you hints to improve your code, take them and run with them. It is good to adjust and work through the problems with the interviewer to show your thought process and problem solving ability.
The Engineer will also want to ascertain your level of interest in the role. Have some questions prepared, for example, what is involved in the role, day to day tasks, what is the most exciting project they have worked on in Facebook etc
Please research recent news online for talking points and more information about Facebook. Finally, be passionate! It can be a game-changer when interviewers notice how excited you are about learning new things or solving new problems.
Go to Program Creek review the Top 10 algorithms for a Coding Interview. Try to pick a few of the classic examples to solve by hand and from scratch on a blank sheet of paper. Time yourself so you are completing each question within 15-20 minutes. This exercise should best prepare you with what to expect during the interview. 
Don't worry about rote memorization such as runtimes or API/native calls. It's always good to know how to figure out approximate runtimes on the fly but the code you write is more important.
Generally avoid solutions that would have lots of edge cases or huge if/elseif/... blocks. Most coding interview questions at most places are designed with semi-elegant solutions so try to identify patterns. Deciding between iteration and recursion is always an important step.
You may be asked in the interview to explain a technically challenging problem you have worked on in the past. Think about and explain how the problem was technically challenging.
