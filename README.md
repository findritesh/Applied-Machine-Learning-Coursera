# Applied-Machine-Learning-Coursera

1. Statistics: We expect all of our data scientists to have a basic level of statistics knowledge that we deem equivalent to what you would learn in an introductory statistics course (hypothesis testing, statistical inference, linear/logistic regression, general experimentation practices and interpretation of data, etc.). Beyond the basics, we focus on open-ended applied statistics problems drawn from the experience on your resume (i.e. predictive analytics, ML) and related areas.

2. SQL - joins, aggregations, subqueries, etc. Some helpful resources:

3. Coding (Python, R, etc… but you can use whatever language you are MOST comfortable with) - focus on topics that relate to data science: data processing for structured and unstructured data, data mining/parsing, data structures/algorithms such as arrays, hash tables/dictionaries, etc. Examples: parsing a data file and storing it in a data structure; given a string of characters, find the frequency of a specific character.

While the phone will focus mainly on data processing questions, a potential future onsite portion requires the ability to manipulate data structures and implement common algorithms. Here is a resource with common data structures/algorithms (arrays, lists, dictionaries/hashtables, trees, graph search, etc.) that we provide for all data scientists that proceed to the onsite interview stage: http://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/ . We don’t expect coding at the level of a software engineer, but having some general purpose programming background in the methods listed will set you up for success in that portion of our interviews later on.

**Some additional tips**
-Expect 2-3 questions in each of the 3 areas listed.
-The questions are designed to be quick due to the short amount of time in a phone interview, so expect to spend no more than 5-10 minutes on each question.
-For the coding portion, we have found that either R or Python works best in terms of speed and efficiency, but we won't discourage you from using your strongest language as we are a language agnostic company. We recommend a brute force approach to the code and then optimizing afterwards.

-For the statistics portion, if you encounter questions that you are less familiar with, try to propose a more informal ad-hoc solution if you don't remember exact terms or details.
-Communicate thought process and assumptions aloud to the interviewer and they will be able to provide any guidance on expectations.

You should have a computer on hand for the interview as the coding portion will involve using a shared screen website (Coderpad: https://coderpad.io/ ), where you can select and switch between any of the languages available. We will generate a unique link for you to access during your interview.
